        <h2>Postaflya privacy policy</h2>

        Postaflya (we” or “us”) values its visitors’ privacy. This privacy policy summarizes what information we might collect from a registered user or other visitor (“you”), and what we will and will not do with it.

If you visit a Web site that we mention or link to, be sure to review its privacy policy before providing the site with information.
