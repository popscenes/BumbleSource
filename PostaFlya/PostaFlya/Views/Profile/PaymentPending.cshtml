    <h3>What’s this I have to pay?</h3>
    <p>
        PostaFlya is aimed at helping local communities by providing an online noticeboard. By charging a nominal fee we hope to turn away potential spammers and keep PostaFlya for those who need and can benefit from the service. The cost for the average Flya is about $1 so it really is a small fee to get your message out and online.
    </p>
    <p>
        Secondly PostaFlya is not brought to you by a big international conglomerate, it is brought to you by 2 guys from Melbourne Australia working after hours in their bedrooms. The small fee we ask helps us cover the running costs and maybe one day we’ll get to work on this full time and our wives can have their husbands back.
    </p>
    
    <h3>How do I Pay?</h3>
    <p>
        Flya’s on this screen require you to add credits before they will become active. Click the “ADD CREDITS” button to go to our payment screen and add some Flya credits to your account! Once you have added credits you will brought back to this screen you can think click the PAY FOR FLYA button to activate the Flya for the specified number of credits.
